Carmen.js allows easy site customization based on your users' physical location.

With just one or two lines of javascript you can have your site show different content to your visitors based on your nearest branch, or for users who are near your business or not.

## Carmen.js is currently under heavy construction!
Feel free to **Star** and **Watch** it, but watch out for falling debris, and a wildly changing API.

Feedback and contributions are always welcome and appreciated.
